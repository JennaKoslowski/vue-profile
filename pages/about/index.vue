    <h1>About Me:</h1>
    <p> I am a front-end web developer who focuses on JavaScript with experience with React and Vue.
        I was a recipient of the Grow With Google Scholarship in 2018 and was chosen to receive the full nanodegree
        which I completed in November of 2018. Since then I have been looking deeper into CSS and other JavaScript libraries and frameworks.</p> 
    <br>
    <p> I took a couple web development classes and created a personal blog and realized I loved creating websites.
        Ultimately I decided I would delve deeper into computer programming more in depth after graduation and kept that promise to myself. 
        During my studies I fell deeper and deeper into the programming world and can't imagine not creating.</p>
    <br>
    <p> The more I learn about websites the more I have become curious about other technologies and the way technology impacts our lives.
        It's facinating how ingrained technology has become in our lives and how advanced it is. 
        Between artificial intelligence and having the entire internet in our pockets there's no end to the possibilities.</p>
