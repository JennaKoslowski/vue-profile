        About Me
    </h1>
    <p> I am a front-end web developer who focuses on JavaScript with experience with React and Vue.
        I was a recipient of the Grow With Google Scholarship in 2018 and was chosen to receive the full nanodegree
        which I completed in November of 2018. Since then I have been looking deeper into CSS and other JavaScript libraries and frameworks.</p> 
    <br>
    <p> Since the beginning of my learning I fell deeper and deeper into the programming world and can't imagine not creating.</p>
    <br>
    <p> The more I learn about websites the more I have become curious about other technologies and the way technology impacts our lives.
        It's facinating how ingrained technology has become in our lives and how advanced it is. 
        Between artificial intelligence, machine learning and having the entire internet in our pockets there's no end to the possibilities.</p>
