    <h1>About Me:</h1>
    <p> I am a front-end web developer who focuses on JavaScript and Vue with experience with React.
        I was a recipient of the Grow With Google Scholarship in 2018 and was chosen to receive the full nanodegree
        which I completed in November of 2018. Since then I have been looking deeper into CSS and other JavaScript libraries and frameworks.</p>
